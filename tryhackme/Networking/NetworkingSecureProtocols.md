# Room: Networking Secure Protocols (TryHackMe)

**Date:** 20 Sept 2025
**Path:** Cyber Security 101
**Goal:** Learn about secure networking protocols, encryption, and how secure communication is established over the Internet.

## 1. Key Concepts Learned

* **TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security / Secure Sockets Layer)**: Encryption protocols that secure communication between client and server.

  * TLS has replaced SSL in modern usage.
  * Works using asymmetric encryption (certificates) to establish a secure session key.
* **HTTPS**: HTTP over TLS/SSL, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of web traffic.
* **SMTPS, POP3S, IMAPS**: Secure versions of email protocols (SMTP, POP3, IMAP) that use TLS to protect communication.
* **SSH (Secure Shell)**: Provides encrypted remote access to systems; replaces older insecure methods like Telnet.
* **SFTP vs. FTPS**:

  * **SFTP**: File transfer over SSH.
  * **FTPS**: File transfer using FTP over TLS.
* **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: Creates an encrypted “tunnel” for secure communication across untrusted networks.

## 2. Commands / Tools Practiced

* Reviewed HTTPS vs HTTP in browser examples and packet captures.

## 3. Takeaways

* TLS/SSL is the backbone of secure Internet communication — without it, credentials and data would be exposed.
* Secure versions of email and file transfer protocols are essential for modern infrastructure.
* SSH is a must-know tool for sysadmins, developers, and penetration testers alike.
* VPNs protect users on untrusted networks (like public Wi-Fi) and can also connect private networks securely.

## 4. Next Steps

* Explore SSL/TLS certificates in depth (self-signed vs CA-signed).
* Practice capturing and analyzing TLS handshakes in Wireshark.
* Learn about common SSH hardening practices (key-based authentication, disabling root login).
* Experiment with setting up a simple VPN (e.g., OpenVPN or WireGuard).
