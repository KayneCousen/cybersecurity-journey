# Room: Windows Command Line (TryHackMe)

**Date:** 14 Sept 2025
**Path:** Cyber Security 101
**Goal:** Learn the fundamentals of the Windows Command Prompt and how to navigate, manage files, and gather system information.

## 1. Key Concepts Learned

* Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe) is a text-based interface for interacting with the OS.
* Commands are often case-insensitive but follow strict syntax.
* Key navigation concepts: drives (`C:\`, `D:\`) and directories.
* Wildcards (`*`, `?`) are useful for filtering and searching files.
* Standard input/output redirection (`>`, `>>`, `<`, `|`) helps chain commands.

## 2. Commands / Tools Practiced

* `cd`, `dir`, `type`, `copy`, `move`, `del` for navigation and file management.
* `ipconfig`, `systeminfo`, `tasklist` for system and network info.
* `find`, `findstr` to search through files.
* Redirection: `dir > files.txt` to output directory listing into a file.

## 3. Takeaways

* Command Prompt provides fast and lightweight access for file, system, and network tasks.
* Many system administration and penetration testing tools rely on cmd basics.
* Redirection and piping allow chaining simple commands into more powerful operations.

## 4. Next Steps

* Move into PowerShell for advanced scripting and automation.
* Use Command Prompt in CTF/engagements for quick reconnaissance.
