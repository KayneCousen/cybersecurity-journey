# Room: Windows PowerShell (TryHackMe)

**Date:** 14 Sept 2025
**Path:** Cyber Security 101
**Goal:** Understand PowerShell as a powerful Windows shell and scripting environment.

## 1. Key Concepts Learned

* PowerShell is built on the .NET framework, allowing access to system objects (not just text).
* Uses cmdlets (verb-noun format) like `Get-Process`, `Set-ExecutionPolicy`.
* Supports scripting, automation, and task management.
* Objects, pipelines, and filtering are core differences from Command Prompt.

## 2. Commands / Tools Practiced

* `Get-Help` to learn about cmdlets.
* `Get-Command` to list available commands.
* `Get-Service`, `Start-Service`, `Stop-Service` for service management.
* `Get-Process`, `Stop-Process` for process control.
* `Select-Object`, `Where-Object` to filter and format outputs.

## 3. Takeaways

* PowerShell is far more powerful than Command Prompt because it works with objects, not just text.
* Pipelines allow transforming and filtering structured data efficiently.
* Essential for both administrators and attackers for automation, reconnaissance, and exploitation.

## 4. Next Steps

* Practice writing basic PowerShell scripts.
