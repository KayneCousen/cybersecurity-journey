# Room: Metasploit: Introduction (TryHackMe)

**Date:** 6 Oct 2025  
**Path:** Cyber Security 101  
**Goal:** Learn the main components of the Metasploit Framework, how to use `msfconsole`, and how modules, payloads and tools fit into exploitation workflows.  

## 1. Key Concepts Learned

* **Metasploit Overview**:

  * Metasploit Framework is an open-source exploitation framework used for pentesting, exploit development, and post-exploitation.  
  * There is also a commercial Metasploit Pro with GUI features; this room focuses on the Framework/`msfconsole`. citeturn0view0

* **Main Components of Metasploit**:

  * **msfconsole**: primary interactive CLI for discovering and using modules.  
  * **Modules**: categorized as `auxiliary` (scanners, fuzzers), `exploits`, `payloads`, `post`, `encoders`, `evasion`, `nops`, etc. citeturn0view0
  * **Payloads**: singles (inline) vs staged (stager + stage) and how stagers download stages for larger payloads. citeturn0view0
  * **Tools**: standalone helpers like `msfvenom`, `pattern_create`, `pattern_offset` used for payload generation and exploit development. citeturn0view0

* **Exploit / Vulnerability / Payload Concepts**:

  * **Exploit**: code that triggers a vulnerability.  
  * **Vulnerability**: flaw in code or design.  
  * **Payload**: code executed on the target after exploitation (e.g., shell, meterpreter). citeturn0view0

* **msfconsole Basics**:

  * Launch with `msfconsole`. The console provides search, `use`, `set` commands and module lifecycle (select, configure, run). citeturn0view0
  * Common workflow: `search` → `use exploit/...` → `set RHOSTS`/`set LHOST`/`set PAYLOAD` → `exploit` / `run`. citeturn0view0

## 2. Commands / Tools Practiced

* `msfconsole` — start the Metasploit console.  
* `search <term>` — find modules matching a keyword.  
* `use <module>` — select a module (exploit/auxiliary/etc.).  
* `show options` — display configurable options for the selected module.  
* `set <option> <value>` — configure module options (`RHOSTS`, `LPORT`, `PAYLOAD`, etc.).  
* `exploit` or `run` — execute the selected module.  
* `msfvenom` — generate payloads (shellcode, executables) and encoding.  
* Inspect module folders under `/opt/metasploit-framework/embedded/framework/modules` for categories like `auxiliary/`, `exploits/`, `payloads/`, etc. citeturn0view0

## 3. Takeaways

* Metasploit organizes a huge catalog of exploits, payloads and supporting modules; learning to search and configure modules is core to effective use.  
* Understanding the difference between inline (single) payloads and staged payloads helps when selecting payloads for different scenarios.  
* Encoders and evasion modules exist but are not a silver bullet against modern AV; they may obfuscate but not guarantee bypass.  
* `msfvenom` is useful for creating payloads and experimenting with different formats when testing. citeturn0view0

## 4. Next Steps

* Practice typical `msfconsole` workflows in a lab: discover vulnerable services, pick an exploit, configure payloads, and get a shell in a safe environment.  
* Learn Meterpreter post-exploitation modules and persistence techniques (lab-only).  
* Explore `msfvenom` payload generation and try encoding/formatting payloads for different target platforms.  
* Read Metasploit module source code to understand how exploits are implemented and what options they require.
